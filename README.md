“Keep going where you’re going Now rather than Later. Listen to its lessons, learn the ways of that cache. As if. As if it weren't empty at all.” He whispered at it.
I leaned in, refraining that whisper. “That Cache that I saw Before? You’re saying I’ll see it again Later?”
“Enough about Before and Later! Think only of that Only, Now!”
From an empty cache of cheese on that lonesome prairie where nothing ever happens, Swami B had finally heard the esoteric good news of the Now.  All he had to do was look upside down at nothing! 
      But  it was so easy to forget, and forget he almost always did. And how could Swami share the oftimes cheesy news that it is always Now in that world of clown chefs, judge chefs, and everyone in between? In a radically  downside up world where Everyone will look at Everything but Nothing, he’s got his work cut out for him.   Watch as cannon balls splay lizards with eyes sewn shut into an encounter with the absent Adversary.  Be still as bongs of uncertain materials become archetypes for comically useless wisdom smoking itself silly.  Behold Swami’s own Yogi teacher throwing the knuckler to himself, ya screwball! Explore the cases of cases and  bags of bags of receipts for receipts. And through it all, let the contagious joy build as Swami B learns to love whatever whatevers him, not later, but right McFreakin’ Now.
